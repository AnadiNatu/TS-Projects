How to compile the TS code without Code Runner Extension

Step 1 - Open Main Folder in PowerShell
Step 2 - Write cmd tsc -init
Step 3 - Open the powerShell , write tsc .\file.path
Step 4 - Change the version of the target property in ts.config to ES6 
Step 5 - Additional step , if you dont want to comile every ts file in you folder
you can add "files" property in ts.config and include the ts file you  want to compile .
Syntax - "files": ["arrays.ts"]

Step 6 - You can use "include" property , with which you can specify a folder path , ts files of which you wanted to be compiled . Syntax - ["include"] : ["src/**/*"]

Step 7 - Similarly you can also use "exclude" property to specify the ts files you don't want to be converted to . Syntax - "exclude" : ["src/gg.ts" , "src/tt.ts"] 

Step 8 - Now if you want your compiled JS file to go to a separate folder . We need to uncomment the "outDir" property in config file and specify the folder we need our JS compiled files to go to . Syntax - "outDir": "./dist",    




TypeScript is a syntactic superset of Java Script which adds "static " typing

This basically means that TS adds syntax on top of JavaScript , allowing developers to add types

A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

TS is transpiled into JS using a complier

TS converted into JS means it runs anywhere that JS runs
